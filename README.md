# InstaDog
A Python >= 3.5 script for automatic dog posting. The script pulls a random image from https://dog.ceo/dog-api/ and a random quote from a list of dog-related quotes from a text file, dogquotes.txt. The script uses Selenium and an AutoIt3 script to spoof a mobile version of chrome using a chromedriver, login to Instagram using user credentials, upload the photo from the user's machine (AutoIt3), write the description including breed specific hashtags and the random quote, and post it to Instagram.
